If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

LaTeX does not know anything more about this error, sorry.
Try typing <return> to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.

and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
